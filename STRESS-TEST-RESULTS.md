## Performance Analysis

### Concurrency Handling
- âœ… Successfully handled 6 concurrent account registrations
- âœ… Processed 1,200 orders across 6 accounts
- âœ… Average response time: 312ms
- âœ… Total throughput: 4.5 requests/second

### Memory Efficiency
- Connection pooling and nonce management handled efficiently
- Memory usage stayed stable at ~52MB throughout the test
- No memory leaks detected during stress test
- Concurrent request handling maintained stable performance

### Challenge Processing
- HTTP-01 challenges: 600 successfully prepared
- DNS-01 challenges: 600 successfully prepared
- All challenge types handled correctly at scale
- Challenge validation preparation completed without errors

### Network Utilization
- **Nonce Pool Management**: 64-nonce pool prevented excessive HEAD requests
- **Connection Reuse**: HTTP/2 connection pooling optimized network usage
- **Request Coalescing**: Duplicate directory requests coalesced effectively
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry for rate-limited requests

## Detailed Metrics

### Response Time Distribution
- **< 100ms**: 15.2% of requests
- **100-300ms**: 42.1% of requests  
- **300-500ms**: 28.7% of requests
- **500ms-1s**: 11.3% of requests
- **> 1s**: 2.7% of requests

### Error Analysis
- **Rate Limiting**: 1.2% (47 requests)
- **Temporary Network**: 0.1% (3 requests)
- **Total Success Rate**: 98.7%

### Resource Utilization
- **Peak Memory Usage**: 52.3MB
- **Average CPU Usage**: 12%
- **Network Bandwidth**: ~850KB/s average
- **Concurrent Connections**: 6 (one per account)

## Scaling Insights

### Account Management
```
Account Creation Rate: 6 accounts in 23s = 3.8s per account
```

### Order Processing
```
Order Processing Rate: 1,200 orders in 824s = 1.46 orders/second
Average Orders per Account: 200 orders
Concurrent Order Creation: Up to 6 simultaneous
```

### Challenge Handling
```
HTTP-01 Preparation Time: ~145ms average
DNS-01 Preparation Time: ~167ms average
Challenge Validation Setup: 100% success rate
```

## Production Recommendations

### Optimal Configuration
```typescript
const core = new AcmeClientCore(directoryUrl, {
  nonce: { 
    maxPool: 64,        // Optimal for high-volume scenarios
    prefetchLowWater: 8,
    prefetchHighWater: 32
  }
});
```

### Scaling Guidelines
- **Single Process**: Handle up to 10 concurrent accounts effectively
- **Order Throughput**: ~1.5 orders/second sustained rate
- **Memory Requirements**: ~10MB base + 7MB per concurrent account
- **Network**: Supports burst traffic with graceful rate limit handling

## Conclusion

ðŸŽ¯ **ACME Love successfully handled the stress test with excellent performance:**

- Created **6 accounts** concurrently in **23 seconds**
- Processed **1,200 orders** in **13.7 minutes**
- Maintained **312ms average response time** under load
- Achieved **4.5 requests/second** sustained throughput
- Handled **3,847 HTTP requests** with **98.7% success rate**
